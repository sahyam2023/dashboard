How it should work:
Super admin can enable/disable maintenance mode from their super admin dashboard.

All non-super-admin users are logged out.
Only super admins can log in.
Login page displays a “Maintenance mode is ON” message for regular users.
When disabled:
All users can log in again as normal.

Part 4: Advanced/Complex (Hardest, Most Time-Consuming)
1. Real-Time Notifications (WebSocket/push)
Show notifications instantly as events happen, using WebSockets or push technology.
notications can include like xyz user added document name, for description

Notification Types to Implement
Document Added: “User X added document Y”
Document Deleted: “User X deleted document Y”
Document Updated: “User X updated document Y”
Bulk Actions: “User X deleted 5 documents”
Permission/Access Changed: “Your access to document Y was updated”
Comment/Note Added: “User X commented on document Y”
File Upload/Download Completed: “Your upload/download of document Y is complete”
System Alerts: “Scheduled maintenance at 2:00 AM”
Error/Failure: “Failed to upload document Y”
User Mentioned: “User X mentioned you in document Y”

Subscription vs. Default
Default:
Show important notifications (like document changes, errors, mentions) to all users by default.
Allow users to customize which notifications they receive (e.g., only for documents they follow, or only mentions).
This can be added as an advanced feature late
