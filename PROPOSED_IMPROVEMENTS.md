# Proposed Dashboard Improvements

This document outlines suggested features, fixes, and UI/UX enhancements to make the dashboard more professional, user-friendly, and robust.

## I. General UI/UX Enhancements

1.  **Consistent Styling:**
    *   Further solidify your design language using Tailwind CSS for all components (tables, forms, buttons, modals).
    *   Define and reuse common styling classes.


4.  **Enhanced Feedback (Toast Notifications):**
    *   Replace or augment the current `feedbackMessage` system with toast notifications (e.g., using `react-toastify` or `sonner`) for non-intrusive and modern feedback on actions.



## II. Feature Suggestions for User-Facing Dashboard (e.g., `DocumentsView`, `PatchesView`)

1.  **Bulk Actions (for Admins):**
    *   Implement checkbox-based selection in tables for bulk operations like "Delete Selected," "Change Category/Software for Selected."





## IV. Fixes/Improvements Based on Code Review

1.  **Error Handling in Data Fetching:**
    *   When API calls fail during data refresh (pagination, sorting), keep stale data visible and show a non-intrusive error toast instead of clearing the view.
2.  **Feedback Message Handling:**
    *   Transition from `feedbackMessage` state to toast notifications for a more standard and less obtrusive user experience.
3.  **Admin Form Enhancements (e.g., `AdminDocumentEntryForm`):**
    *   Review and improve forms for clearer validation feedback, appropriate input types, loading/disabled states on submission, and better file upload UX.
